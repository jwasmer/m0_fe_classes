# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It took me awhile to get the final challenge, but it felt great to see my code actually execute correctly. I spent loads of time searching the internet for different ways to solve the problem, but the answer actually ended up being pretty simple. Taking a step away for a short break helped as well.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My workflow has been going well. I'm looking forward to having my desk set up after I finish moving next week, but otherwise I've been managing distractions and projects pretty well.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

My desk to be set up! My biggest friction point right now is my workspace, but I'm in the middle of a move so there's not much to do about it right now. I'll be glad to have everything in order for Mod 1 though.
